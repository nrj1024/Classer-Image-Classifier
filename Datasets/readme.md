The datasets in the zip aren't that great when it comes to the number or quality and neither have been trained for a long time. However, they a good enough for a demo with training accuracy of ~80-90%. You can load them directly by choosing their respective folders as they already have the saved weights in 'model.h5'.

Remember, the larger and cleaner the dataset would be, the better results you'll get. You can always modify the source code to better suit your needs. However, the most easy way to get better results would be to increase the number of EPOCHS in classifier.py
